Yesterday's session : Dealing with application properties
--------------------------------------------------------------

-> As part of application execution we need to display few messages like success and failure msgs.

-> It is not at all recommended to hard code success and failure messages in source code.

-> To avoid hard coding we will configure msgs in application.properties file or application.yml file

-> In boot application, we can application.yml file msgs into java class using below annotations

	@ConfigurationProperties
	@EnableConfigurationProperties

------------------------------------------------------------------
-> It is not recommended to write duplicate string literals in our source code.

-> To avoid duplicate String literals we will use Constants.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Today's session : Code Review
------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Code Review is the process of verifying coding standards followed by developers in coding.

-> In realtime Code Review will happen in 2 ways

	1) Automated Review using Tool
	2) Peer Review

-> We will use SonarQube server to perform code review. It will verify our source code and it will identify problems in our code.

Note: Sonar Qube will not check logic of the program is correct or not.

-> Peer Review is the process of verifying logic of the program. Juniour developers logic will be verified by senior developers in the project.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

What is SonarQube?
------------------
-> SonarQube is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource    for continuous inspection of code quality to perform automatic      reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs, code    smells, and security vulnerabilities on 20+ programming    languages.

-> SonarQube developed using Java
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Installing Sonar Software in Local
--------------------------------------
-> Download Sonar Software from below url
	
	URL : https://www.sonarqube.org/downloads/
	Version : 6.3.1

-> Start Sonar Server by executing StartSonar.bat	

	Location :Sonar-Folder/bin/windows64/StartSonar.bat

-> Once Sonar Server is started it will display Sonar up and running message in console.

-> By Default Sonar Server will run on 9000 port number

-> Open Sonar Server Dashboard using below URL	
	http://localhost:9000/


Running Project with SonarQube Server
-------------------------------------
Add below 1 plugin in project pom.xml file (in <build> tag)

<plugin>
   <groupId>org.sonarsource.scanner.maven</groupId>
   <artifactId>sonar-maven-plugin</artifactId>
   <version>3.4.0.905</version>
</plugin>

-> Do Maven build of project with below goal
	
	mvn clean compile package

-> For project do maven build with below goal To Do Code Review
	
	mvn sonar:sonar

-> After maven build completed, check sonar server dashboard.
	
-> We can our project report under Projects

-> Report contains below details
	
		1) Bugs(Blocker, Critical, Major & Minor)
		2) Vunerabilities
		3) Code Smells
		4) Code Coverage
		5) Duplicates etc...
