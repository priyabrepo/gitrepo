1) Class: It is only a logical component and not the physical entity. 

2) Object: An object can be defined as an instance of a class, and there can be multiple instances of a class in a program. 

3) Inheritance: one object acquires the properties and behaviors of the parent object. It’s creating a parent-child relationship between two classes.

4) Polymorphism: Overriding

5) Abstraction: abstract class interface

6) Encapsulation: acess modifiers.

7) Association:  many students can associate with one teacher while one student can also associate with multiple teachers.

8) Aggregation: consider class/objects department and teacher.
                Here, a single teacher can’t belong to multiple departments, but even if we delete the department, the teacher object will never be destroyed.

9) Composition:  House and rooms. Any house can have several rooms. One room can’t become part of two different houses. So, if you delete the house room will also be deleted
