Spring
--------
Spring is a lightweight framework. It can be thought of as a framework of frameworks because it provides support to various frameworks such as Struts,
 Hibernate, Tapestry, EJB, JSF, etc. The framework, in broader sense, can be defined as a structure where we find solution of the various technical problems.
 
 
Inversion Of Control (IOC) 
-----------------------------------------------------
- Inversion of Control is a principle in software engineering by which the control of objects or portions of a program is transferred to a container or framework. 
  It's most often used in the context of object-oriented programming.
-  If we want to add our own behavior, we need to extend the classes of the framework or plugin our own classes.
 
  advantages of Inversion Of Control (IOC)
  ------------------------------------------

1.decoupling the execution of a task from its implementation
2.making it easier to switch between different implementations
3.greater modularity of a program
4.greater ease in testing a program by isolating a component or mocking its dependencies and allowing components to communicate through contracts

 Dependency Injection
 ---------------------
 - Dependency injection is a pattern through which we implement IoC.
 - The act of connecting objects with other objects, or “injecting” objects into other objects, is done by an assembler rather than by the objects themselves.
 
 
ex:
  create an object dependency in traditional programming:

public class Store {
    private Item item;
 
    public Store() {
        item = new ItemImpl1();    
    }
}

   
   By using Dependancy Injection, we can rewrite the example without specifying the implementation of Item that we want:

public class Store {
    private Item item;
    public Store(Item item) {
        this.item = item;
    }
}
 
  - IOC makes the code loosely coupled. so,there is no tight coupling and there is no need to modify the code if our logic is moved to new environment.
  - In Spring framework, IOC container is responsible to inject the dependency. 
  - We provide metadata to the IOC container either by XML file or annotation.
 
Advantage of Dependency Injection
makes the code loosely coupled so easy to maintain
makes the code easy to test
 
 
 
 Advantages of Spring Framework
 ---------------------------------
 1) Predefined Templates
 Spring framework provides templates for JDBC, Hibernate, JPA etc.
 2) Loose Coupling
 The Spring applications are loosely coupled because of dependency injection.
 3) Easy to test
 The Dependency Injection makes easier to test the application. 
 4) Lightweight
 Spring framework is lightweight because of its POJO implementation. The Spring Framework doesn't force the programmer to inherit any class or implement any interface.
 That is why it is said non-invasive.
 5) Fast Development
 The Dependency Injection feature of Spring Framework and it support to various frameworks makes the easy development of JavaEE application.
 6) Powerful abstraction
 It provides powerful abstraction to JavaEE specifications such as JMS, JDBC, JPA and JTA.
 7) Declarative support
 It provides declarative support for caching, validation, transactions and formatting.
 
 
 
 Spring Modules
 ---------------
1.Test
This layer provides support of testing with JUnit and TestNG.

2.Spring Core Container
The Spring Core container contains core, beans, context and expression language (EL) modules.
   - Core and Beans
     These modules provide IOC and Dependency Injection features.
   - Context
     This module supports internationalization (I18N), EJB, JMS, Basic Remoting.
   - Expression Language
     It is an extension to the EL defined in JSP. It provides support to setting and getting property values,
     method invocation, accessing collections and indexers, named variables, logical and arithmetic operators, retrieval of objects by name etc.

3.AOP, Aspects and Instrumentation
These modules support aspect oriented programming implementation where you can use Advices, Pointcuts etc. to decouple the code.
The aspects module provides support to integration with AspectJ.
The instrumentation module provides support to class instrumentation and classloader implementations.

4.Data Access / Integration
This group comprises of JDBC, ORM, OXM, JMS and Transaction modules. These modules basically provide support to interact with the database.

5.Web
This group comprises of Web, Web-Servlet, Web-Struts and Web-Portlet. These modules provide support to create web application.
 
 IoC Container
 ---------------
 - The IoC container is responsible to instantiate, configure and assemble the objects.
 - The IoC container gets informations from the XML file and works accordingly.
 
 The main tasks performed by IoC container are:

1.to instantiate the application class
2.to configure the object
3.to assemble the dependencies between the objects

There are two types of IoC containers.(interfaces)
  1.BeanFactory - org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory // depriciated
  2.ApplicationContext - org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext
  
The ApplicationContext interface is built on top of the BeanFactory interface.
It adds some extra functionality than BeanFactory such as simple integration with Spring's AOP, message resource handling (for I18N), event propagation, application layer specific context 
(e.g. WebApplicationContext) for web application. 
So it is better to use ApplicationContext than BeanFactory.
 
 ex: ApplicationContext context =  new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");  
 
 Dependency Injection (DI)
 --------------------------
 - a design pattern that removes the dependency from the programming code so that it can be easy to manage and test the application. 
 - Dependency Injection makes our programming code loosely coupled. 
 
 Dependency Lookup and its disadvantages.
 -----------------------------------------
 - The Dependency Lookup is an approach where we get the resource after demand. 
 
 ways of dependancy injection:
 - A obj = new AImpl();  
 - A obj = A.getA(); 
 - (By JNDI (Java Naming Directory Interface) )
   Context ctx = new InitialContext();  
   Context environmentCtx = (Context) ctx.lookup("java:comp/env");  
   A obj = (A)environmentCtx.lookup("A");  
   
 Problems
 1.Tightly coupling.
 2. Not easy for testing.
 
 Dependency Injection
 --------------------
 The Dependency Injection is a design pattern that removes the dependency of the programs. In such case we provide the information from the external source such as XML file. 
 
Two ways to perform Dependency Injection in Spring framework

1.By Constructor
2.By Setter method

By Constructor:
--------------
ex:
gitrepo\workspace\springWS\springFirst\src\main\java\com\spring\constructorDI\TestEmployee.java
gitrepo\workspace\springWS\springFirst\src\main\java\DIconstructor.xml

- which constructor will be called, depends on the <constructor-arg> passed from the xml.
- if no  <constructor-arg> passed. default constructor will be called.
- for string type <constructor-arg>, we dont have to define type.(by default takes as string.)
- if <constructor-arg> doesnot match any constructor, Error.Unsatisfied dependency...
Injecting Object
-------------------
- Define the injecting class bean first.
- The ref attribute is used to define the reference of another object, such way we are passing the dependent object as an constructor argument.

ex:
gitrepo\workspace\springWS\springFirst\src\main\java\PersonContext.xml
gitrepo\workspace\springWS\springFirst\src\main\java\com\spring\constructorDI\TestPerson.java

Injecting collections
----------------------
- We can inject collection values by constructor in spring framework
- There can be used three elements inside the constructor-arg element.
   1.list
   2.set
   3.map
- For list<String>,
   ex:gitrepo\workspace\springWS\springFirst\src\main\java\ConfigQuestion.xml
      gitrepo\workspace\springWS\springFirst\src\main\java\com\spring\constructorDI\TestQsn.java	  
<constructor-arg>  
<list>  
<value>Java is a programming language</value>  
<value>Java is a Platform</value>  
<value>Java is an Island of Indonasia</value>  
</list>  
</constructor-arg> 

- for list<Object>
ex: gitrepo\workspace\springWS\springFirst\src\main\java\configQstn1.xml
    gitrepo\workspace\springWS\springFirst\src\main\java\com\spring\constructorDI\Questions1.java
	
- for Map<String,String>
ex:/springFirst/src/main/java/DepartmentConfig.xml
   /springFirst/src/main/java/com/spring/constructorDI/Department.java

- for Map<Obj,obj>
ex:/springFirst/src/main/java/CompnyContext.xml
   /springFirst/src/main/java/com/spring/constructorDI/TestComp.java
   
- for bean inheriting bean:
parent=""
ex: /springFirst/src/main/java/InheritBeanContext.xml
    /springFirst/src/main/java/com/spring/constructorDIInherit/Person.java

Setter Injection
------------------
use <property> insted of <constructor-arg>

Setter Injection VS Constructor Injection
------------------------------------------
- Partial dependency: can be injected using setter injection but it is not possible by constructor. Suppose there are 3 properties in a class, having 3 arg constructor and setters methods. 
  In such case, if you want to pass information for only one property, it is possible by setter method only.
  
- Overriding: Setter injection overrides the constructor injection. If we use both constructor and setter injection, IOC container will use the setter injection.

- Changes: We can easily change the value by setter injection. It doesn't create a new bean instance always like constructor. So setter injection is flexible than constructor injection.

Autowiring in Spring  - check again.(and factory method)
--------------------
- Autowiring feature of spring framework enables you to inject the object dependency implicitly.
- It internally uses setter or constructor injection.
- Autowiring can't be used to inject primitive and string values.It works with reference only.

No.	Mode	             Description
1)	no	                It is the default autowiring mode. It means no autowiring by default.
2)	byName	            The byName mode injects the object dependency according to name of the bean. In such case, property name and bean name must be same. It internally calls setter method.
3)	byType	            The byType mode injects the object dependency according to type. So property name and bean name can be different. It internally calls setter method.
4)	constructor      	The constructor mode injects the dependency by calling the constructor of the class. It calls the constructor having large number of parameters.
5)	autodetect	        It is deprecated since Spring 3.
