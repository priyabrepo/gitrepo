Spring Boot
**********************************

- Spring Boot is a Spring module that provides the RAD (Rapid Application Development) feature to the Spring framework.
- Spring Boot is a project that is built on the top of the Spring Framework. It provides an easier and faster way to set up, configure, and run both simple and web-based applications
  (RESTfull services)/ not ui...
- In short, Spring Boot is the combination of Spring Framework and Embedded Servers.
- In Spring Boot, there is no requirement for XML configuration (deployment descriptor). 
   It uses framework to reduce configurations (convention over configuration software design paradigm) that means it decreases the effort of the developer.
   
Why Spring Boot Framework?

-The dependency injection approach is used in Spring Boot.
-It contains powerful database transaction management capabilities.
-It simplifies integration with other Java frameworks like JPA/Hibernate ORM, Struts, etc.
-It reduces the cost and development time of the application.

Spring sister projects are as follows:

-Spring Data: It simplifies data access from the relational and NoSQL databases.
-Spring Batch: It provides powerful batch processing.
-Spring Security: It is a security framework that provides robust security to applications.
-Spring Social: It supports integration with social networking like LinkedIn.
-Spring Integration: It is an implementation of Enterprise Integration Patterns. 
  It facilitates integration with other enterprise applications using lightweight messaging and declarative adapters.
  
Advantages of Spring Boot
- It creates stand-alone Spring applications that can be started using Java -jar.
- It tests web applications easily with the help of different Embedded HTTP servers such as Tomcat, Jetty, etc. We don't need to deploy WAR files.
- It provides opinionated 'starter' POMs to simplify our Maven configuration.
- It provides production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration.
- There is no requirement for XML configuration.
- It offers a CLI tool for developing and testing the Spring Boot application.
- It offers the number of plug-ins.
- It also minimizes writing multiple boilerplate codes (the code that has to be included in many places with little or no alteration), XML configuration, and annotations.
- It increases productivity and reduces development time.

Limitations of Spring Boot
- Spring Boot can use dependencies that are not going to be used in the application. These dependencies increase the size of the application.

Goals of Spring Boot
- The main goal of Spring Boot is to reduce development, unit test, and integration test time.

- Provides Opinionated Development approach
- Avoids defining more Annotation Configuration
- Avoids writing lots of import statements
- Avoids XML Configuration.

**************************************


There are four layers in Spring Boot 
- Spring Boot follows a layered architecture in which each layer communicates with the layer directly below or above (hierarchical structure) it.
 1.Presentation Layer
      - The presentation layer handles the HTTP requests, 
	    translates the JSON parameter to object, and authenticates the request and transfer it to the business layer. In short, it consists of views i.e., frontend part.
 2.Business Layer(service,controller)
      - The business layer handles all the business logic. It consists of service classes and uses services provided by data access layers. 
	    It also performs authorization and validation.
 3.Persistence Layer(model(ex:the dao))
      - The persistence layer contains all the storage logic and translates business objects from and to database rows.
 4.Database Layer(data base(ex: sql,oracle))
      - In the database layer, CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) operations are performed.

Spring Initializr Modules
----------------------------
initializr-actuator: It provides additional information and statistics on project generation. It is an optional module.
initializr-bom: In this module, BOM stands for Bill Of Materials. In Spring Boot, BOM is a special kind of POM that is used to control the versions of a project's dependencies. It provides a central place to define and update those versions. It provides flexibility to add a dependency in our module without worrying about the versions.
Outside the software world, the BOM is a list of parts, items, assemblies, and other materials required to create products. It explains what, how, and where to collect required materials.
initializr-docs: It provides documentation.
initializr-generator: It is a core project generation library.
initializr-generator-spring:
initializr-generator-test: It provides a test infrastructure for project generation.
initializr-metadata: It provides metadata infrastructure for various aspects of the projects.
initializr-service-example: It provides custom instances.
initializr-version-resolver: It is an optional module to extract version numbers from an arbitrary POM.
initializr-web: It provides web endpoints for third party clients.
