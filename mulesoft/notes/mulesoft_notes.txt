Mule 4 :
---------

pre requirment
--------------
soap,soap messaging,soap Q,wsdl
jms 
rest

studio
------------
anypoint studio

ESB(Enterprise Service Bus)
---
 - for using SOAP WS.
 - for loos coupling.
 (logical coupling: consumer need not know the service provider and vise versa)
 - 

What is Orchestration ?
----------------------
- the process of co-ordinating with multiple services and getting the desired work done.
- A mule application contains multiple no of work flows which contain orchestration logic.
- Orchestration is implimented thrugh XML

mulesoft provides mule run time.where we can deploy our mule applications.
mule contains XML files. Each XML contain Orchestration logic.

for SOAP - WSDL
for RESTfull - --
for Mulesoft - RAML
 - (by API designer) - for API designing
 - API Exchange / Anypoint Exchange - for publishing APIs
 - API portal - to share the APIs(URLs)
 - API Manager - for Security 
 - Anypoint Editor
 - ipass cloud hub intigration platform(cloud)

  new- project- ws - create
  
  
  download - extract - lunch
  
  set workspace- file - new - mule project-
  giv name- ren time for deployment(avoilable as plugin) - finish
  src/main/mule - XML file(configuration of flow)
  src/main/java - java code.
  resources - configuration/properties files/ml files
  pom - group id : com.company
        artifact id : domain name
		
		two default dependancyes.
		1. mule http connector dependancy
		2. mule socket connector dependancy
		
 purpose:
 listin to http requests at a port
 convert http message to mule message and keep it inside a Q
  - http message contain reqHeader.reqBody
  - to mule format(mule message)
 Mule message is a data structure?JavaClass.contains 2 parts.
    1.Attribute
	2.Payload
conversion
----------
Http header copyed at Attribute.
Http body copyed as Payload.

Any request which will take any(can be any type http, soap..) request into the flow is called in-bound end point

- http listiner will convert the http to mule mesage as attribule and payload and wrape both in another object called mule event

mule event.
 -java class .
 - has 2 parts.
    1. mule mesage(attribute+payload)
	2. variables
in memori Qs aclled channels

****************************************************************************************************************************************8
- mule runtime is a licensed softwere. but a verson comes as build-in along with anypoint studio.
- 2 dependancyes comes by default.
     1.mule-http-connector
     2.mule-sockets-connector
- out side <flow> tag is global. global works for project level ex: HttpListiner

Java Module
---------------
- import mule-java
- create package in  src/main/java
   
Deployment and server
---------------------
deploying in local machine:
----------------------------
downloading mule runtime 4.3.0
 - open internet explorer
 - login to mule > devloper > documentation > mule runtime(chose current verson) > expand run mule engine on primices > download and unzip mule. 
 - open bin folder > lunch mule.bat
 - once the mule starts, .mule file is created. it contains metadata of mule instance.
 - open project in the anypoint studio.
 - rc and export> mule > anypoint studio to mule deployable Archrive > chose a location > create a jar in the location
 - coppy the jar file to ....\mule-enterprise-standalone-4.3.0\apps folder.(the jar will be extracted autometicaly) can creeck in console also.
 - to undeploy an app , delete anchor.txt file created after deployment
 - MEMORY and other configurations are stored in ....mule-enterprise-standalone-4.3.0\conf
 - to change some conf,open wraper.conf
 - wrapper.java.additional.17=-Dlog4j2.disable.jmx=true (no 17th conf. ) > copy pest the line again, make it 18.change after -D
 - logs are stored at ....mule-enterprise-standalone-4.3.0\logs > projectname.log
 - mule uses log4j . configuration can be found at project> src/main/resources/log4j.xml
   eadit <rolling-file-appender>
deploying in anypoint platform:
------------------------------
- login to anypoint > runtime manager > sand box > servers > 
- stop local server. delete .mule folder and app files in app folder.
- at platform,> add platform > copy comand ./amc_setup -H 9db6e1df-05bc-4527-bb6e-0a066016ffb6---412490 server-name
- go to bin directory. lunch cmd at that location > pest > remove ./ (for windows) > replace server-name > enter
- amc - anypoint management center 
- ssl handshake
- 2 files generated at conf: mule-agent.jks,mule-agent.yml
- created server will be listed in server window (created.not running)
- go to bin, run mule.bat
- platform server will start running after some time.
- in platform go to applications > deploy application > upload the jar > deployment server: chose server > give name > deploy >
