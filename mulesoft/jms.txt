JMS(java Messaging services)
--------------------------------
- an API that provides the facility to create, send and read messages.
- It provides loosely coupled, reliable and asynchronous communication.

Advantage of JMS
1) Asynchronous: To receive the message, client is not required to send request. Message will arrive automatically to the client.
2) Reliable: It provides assurance that message is delivered.

two types of messaging domains in JMS.
--------------------------------------------
1.Point-to-Point Messaging Domain
     - one message is delivered to one receiver only.
	 - Here, Queue is used as a message oriented middleware (MOM).
	 - Queue is responsible to hold the message until receiver is ready.
	 - there is no timing dependency between sender and receiver.
2.Publisher/Subscriber Messaging Domain
     - one message is delivered to all the subscribers. 
	 - Here, Topic is used as a message oriented middleware that is responsible to hold and deliver messages.
	 - there is timing dependency between publisher and subscriber.
