Answers to test your knowledge
-----------------------------------
1. What makes a workspace “collaborative”?
Each workspace is stored on Process Platform server according to its organization. If a Source
Control Management (SCM) system is installed, the workspace can be checked into the SCM
server and checked out by other team members who have access to it. In this way, other users
can contribute to the contents of the workspace in a global initiative and share work with their
teammates anywhere in the world.
2. What is the common name given to objects you build in Process Platform (for example,
entities, business process models, case models, business rules, etc.)?
Documents.
3. What are the two types of organizations in Process Platform? What are the differences
between them?
System and Development.
The System Organization is included by default with every Process Platform installation. It is
the single organization which a system administrator will use to manage information relevant
to the entire Process Platform system. It is not intended for development, nor is it intended for
any user other than the system administrator.
Development organizations are created by the Process Platform system administrator in order
to perform development work. These organizations are created specific to each business.
Users are granted access to these organizations by the system administrator to perform
certain duties (e.g., developer, deployer, analyst, etc.) relevant to the organization.
4. Which property or building block is automatically added to a new entity? What is the
significance of this property?
Identity.
The Identity building block functions as a primary key to help uniquely identify each instance of
the entity. Examples of an Identity may be Product Number for Products, Order ID for Orders,
Social Security Number for People, Employee ID for Employees, etc.
