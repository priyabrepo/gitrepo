Embeded subprocess(in the same BPM)
--------------------
- helps to hide complexity of activities by collapsing an embedded sub-process.
- helps to link time-outs, exceptions and compensates which are common for all activities within the embedded sub-process.
- When a Time-out event is attached to an embedded sub-process, all incomplete tasks are removed from the Inbox.
- If 'terminate activity' is encountered during execution, then all incomplete tasks are removed from the Inbox,
 and the activity is set to 'Obsolete'. This status is visible from the PIM activity view.
 Terminate indicates that the embedded sub-process is terminated and the process flow execution continues 
 from next activity (after embedded sub-process).

independent subprocess (can add external BPM)
-----------------------
- Independent Subprocess is instantiated through a parent process.
- three basic possible outcomes of the transaction:
Successful completion: The process continues in a sequence flow and the transaction is successfully executed.
Cancel: The activities within a transaction are rolled back and specific activities may be compensated.
Exception: The activity is disrupted without any rollback and the flow will continue from the error event.
